The Teta PAPRA project requires 1 PCBAs for v.7

PaprControlPCB - this is a speed controller that allows for adjusting speed of blower

Note:
A PCB is a bare board.
A PCBA is an assembly of a PCB and OTS (off the shelf) components, which are typically a mix of surface mount and thru-hole components.

Board Bring Up Instructions:

1. Connect power to the board via 2.5mm DC jack(H1) using 12V Nominal (7V min, 14V max) DC power, ideally current limitable. Do not connect to fan output.
   A. Note polarity on connector is important, center pin is positive.
   B. Insertion length on connector is 8.4mm, so body of mating jack should be at least this length.
   C. For use with a bech power supply, a cut-end cable option is [Tensility CA-2185](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/tensility-international-corp/CA-2185/568576)
   D. For a standalone power adapter, consier a Tri-Mag L6R06H-120 12V/6W supply
2. For adjustable power supply, set initial current limit to 50mA, which should be sufficient to power up processor and drive LEDs.
3. Turn the potentiomenter/swith (POT1) to ON. 
4. Notice the power LED (LED5) light up with 12V power.
5. Measure 5V regulator (U1) is outputting 5VDC. This can be inspected with a voltmeter measuring the UDPI header as follows:
   A. Pin 2 is GND
   B. Pin 3 is +5V
6. At this point, the board is powered and ready for programming via UPDI. Follow the instructions [here.](https://github.com/tetrabiodistributed/PAPRA-PCB/blob/main/README.md)
