# PAPRA Printed Circuit Board Assembly (PCBA)

Full documentation page for building the PAPRa can be found here: https://tetrabiodistributed.github.io/papra/

Firmware for flashing the PAPRA PCBA can be found here: https://github.com/tetrabiodistributed/papra-pcb-firmware/tree/main/papracode

## Notes for programming

* Make a UPDI Programmer: https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/john-bradnam/create-your-own-updi-programmer-1e55f1?ref=user&ref_id=466812&offset=6
* The board features a UPDI header on the top left of the PCB (top being the side with the battery connectors) the pins are top to bottom 5V, GND and data. 
* Setup Arduino: https://www.hackster.io/john-bradnam/using-the-new-attiny-processors-with-arduino-ide-612185
* You will need to use the megaTinyCore library by SpenceKonde: https://github.com/SpenceKonde/megaTinyCore

Upload settings can be found in the arduino program. 

Please note that there are a number of ATTiny SKUs that are compatible with this PCB and code, please refer to the below table when choosing an appropriate IC.

| ATtiny1614SSN_,| Yes         |    	                           |
| ATtiny1624SSU, | Yes         |    	                           |

(1)ATtiny 204 and 214 have limited (2K) flash memory for program space, but the firmware can be made to fit by sacraficing the bootup LED sequence.
